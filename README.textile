h3. Last Segment extension + plugin for EE 2.0

Often getting the last url segment will be handly - but EE only supports {segment_1}, {segment_2} etc.

This extension will add the following global variables: 

* {last_segment} - last segment (will never be the pagination segment ie /P1)
* {last_segment_absolute} - absolute last segment (even pagination)
* {last_segment_id} - the id of the last segment (for example "3")
* {last_segment_absolute_id} - the id of the absolute last segment

If you don't want to add these global vars you can use the plugin instead:

{exp:last_segment} will return the last segment. {exp:last_segment ignore_pagination='no'} will be the same as {last_segment_absolute}
