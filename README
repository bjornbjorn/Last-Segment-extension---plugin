Last Segment extension + plugin for EE 2.0
==========================================
Often getting the last url segment will be handly - but EE only supports {segment_1}, {segment_2} etc.

This extension will add two global variables: {last_segment} and {last_segment_absolute}

The {last_segment} will never be the pagination segment (ie. /P1)

If you don't want to add these global vars you can use the plugin instead:

{exp:last_segment} will return the last segment. {exp:last_segment ignore_pagination='no'} will be the same as {last_segment_absolute}
